### Data Source
If you would like to run the code yourself please use this [2019 loan dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UpOZPxTVWN-1yhEMBTvP7uiV13iYUsQF/view?usp=sharing) I created.  You can also visit the [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/statistics.action) to explore other year data as well but you need an account to access the data.
